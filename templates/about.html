  <p class="lead">
    The <strong>Employee Performance Predictor</strong> is a machine learning application 
    designed to estimate the productivity of garment workers. By analyzing 
    multiple workplace and operational factors, the model provides insights 
    into expected performance levels.
  </p>

  <hr class="my-4">

  <h4>ðŸ“Š Dataset</h4>
  <p>
    The model is trained on the <em>Garment Worker Productivity</em> dataset, which contains 
    details such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Quarter, Day, Department</li>
    <li>Number of workers and overtime</li>
    <li>Incentives, idle time, idle men</li>
    <li>Work in progress (WIP), SMV (Standard Minute Value)</li>
    <li>Actual productivity (target variable)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>ðŸ¤– Model</h4>
  <p>
    We experimented with multiple regression models including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Linear Regression</li>
    <li>Random Forest Regressor</li>
    <li>XGBoost Regressor</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The final model was chosen based on performance metrics such as 
    <code>MAE</code>, <code>RMSE</code>, and <code>RÂ² score</code>.
  </p>

  <h4>ðŸŽ¯ Purpose</h4>
  <p>
    This tool can help factory managers and analysts understand productivity trends 
    and make informed decisions to improve efficiency and employee well-being.
