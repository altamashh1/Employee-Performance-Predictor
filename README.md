Employee Performance Prediction

Employee productivity plays a crucial role in the success of any organization. This project uses Machine Learning to analyze employee-related factors and predict their performance levels. By leveraging historical data, the model identifies patterns and relationships between variables such as working hours, incentives, idle time, and other key metrics, helping organizations make informed decisions to improve workforce efficiency.

The system is built with:

- Python for data processing and model building

- Scikit-learn and XGBoost for training and prediction

- Flask for deploying the model as a web application

- An intuitive web interface to input employee details and get instant performance predictions.

This application can assist:

- Managers in identifying employees who may require additional support or training

- HR departments in making data-driven evaluations

- Organizations in improving overall productivity through actionable insights
